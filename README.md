# Exam 1 - Programming Part

Complete the tasks found in the code file in this repository, and then commit and push your changes to complete the exam.

## Quick Tips
- Read all instructions carefully.  Focus most on the description of the tasks.
- Don't waste time trying to understand all the functions at first.  Many are not to be modified, and are just there to help do the job.  You DO NOT need to understand how they work in detail.  You only need a general idea what part they play in the overall code.
- As you progress through your changes, feel free to check those same functions for examples of how to do different tasks with your Turtle.
- If you take on the bonus tasks, you will need to import another library.
- Make something beautiful!
